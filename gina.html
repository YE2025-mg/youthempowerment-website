  <div class="profile-content">
    <p>Razafindramonjy Gina is currently studying Public Law at the Faculty of Law and Political Science at the University of Antananarivo. As a young and dedicated individual, she is passionate about the role of youth in shaping the future of the nation, despite the limited opportunities often available to them.</p>

    <p>Her journey in community service began in 2020 with the Youth Empowerment Association, where she volunteered to support the personal development of underprivileged children in public elementary schools. Through her dedication, Gina became a certified facilitator in the Design For Change (DFC) Project—an international program that empowers young learners to create change using their own ideas and resources.</p>

    <p>In 2024, Gina was appointed President of the Environment Section at Youth Empowerment, where she actively promotes environmental action and awareness among youth.</p>

    <p>She is also an activist within the Youth and Citizenship Movement, addressing issues such as Human Rights, Climate Justice, and Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights (SRHR). Her work across these platforms reflects a deep-seated commitment to social equity, civic participation, and the power of youth-driven change.</p>

    <p>For Gina, contributing to humanity is both an honor and a responsibility. She firmly believes that every action matters, and that each of us has the ability to build a better world.</p>
