      <p>Karen Ramamonjisoa, co-founder of the Youth Empowerment association, currently holds the position of volunteer manager, with the aim of strengthening the principles of equity and mutual aid to enable young people to fully realize their potential and put it to the service of the community. Additionally, she is also part of the association's event planning team, where she actively contributes to the smooth running of internal and external activities. In these missions, she highlights her project management skills and her interpersonal skills.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, she is an aspiring young lawyer with a Master's degree in applied private law in progress at the Faculty of Law and Political Science of the University of Antananarivo. With a particular interest in environmental law and criminal law, she is an environmental activist, which is why she is now the facilitator of the association’s sustainable development sector. To effectively carry out this role, she is proficient in the "Human-centered design thinking" project design methodology. Moreover, she keeps up with the fast-paced world of new technology, having developed various technological skills to showcase her creativity, especially in graphic design.</p>
      <p>Determined and dedicated, she believes that age does not determine a person’s worth, but that ambition and goodwill are the drivers of personal growth. In this sense, she is committed to actively pursuing the quest for a society where diversity is recognized as an essential element to promote sustainable development in order to positively impact the country. Outside of the association, she enjoys actively participating in various social activities, whether in the context of academic law conferences or in the sports activities of her community.</p>
