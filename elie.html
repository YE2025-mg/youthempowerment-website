      <p>With a brilliant academic record, Elie Rakotoarimanana, whose full name is Rakotoarimanana Heriniaina Anjara Mamisoa Elie, born on October 11, 2003, in Ambohibao Antehiroka, obtained his Bachelor's degree in General Nursing with honors from the Private University of Madagascar (UPRIM) Andavamamba in 2024, graduating at the top of his class.</p>
      
      <p>His interest in the field of health care was built on a solid foundation, including a Baccalaureate series A2 with honors from Talamatamay High School. Eager to develop a versatile profile, he also enriched his skills with training in office IT (2020) and English language (2021).</p>
      
      <p>His civic engagement and sense of responsibility led him to join the Youth Empowerment association in 2024, where he currently holds the position of Project Manager. This experience allows him to apply his leadership skills, team management, and initiative. He also has strong problem-solving skills, excellent communication skills, a solid sense of organization, and an ability to work independently and as part of a team.</p>
      
      <p>His empathy, which is essential in his field of training, is complemented by his rigor and constant intellectual curiosity. His passion for environmental and climate issues was recognized in 2025 with his election as Youth Champion in this sector.</p>
      
      <p>Although rooted in the field of health, Elie is highly adaptable and excels in team management, leadership, initiative, problem solving, communication, organization, teamwork, and independent work. His career path shows strong resilience, especially in the face of adversity. Having lost his father during his second year of university, he showed determination to successfully continue his studies.</p>
      
      <p>Passionate about improving community health and youth development, his short-term goals are to leverage his skills as a project leader and youth champion to carry out impactful initiatives within Youth Empowerment. In the long term, he aspires to become a leader in the field of public health and sustainable development in Madagascar.</p>
      
      <p><em>"In the field of health, my autonomous leadership flourishes within a social team, with the conviction that our collective action can have a positive impact on the environment and climate."</em></p>
